### Hi there 👋 I'm Harigovindh!

I'm a backend developer with a strong interest in **Java**, **Spring Boot**, and **AI/ML**—especially where data meets performance, like in **Formula 1**.

🚀 Currently building:  
- A secured Spring Boot REST API with JWT & role-based access  
- Data analysis projects related to F1 (Python + Pandas) *(coming soon)*

📌 Currently learning:
- Spring Security & Spring Data JPA  
- Python for Data Science  
- Clean coding and system design basics  

🎯 2025 Goal:
- Switch to a tech role aligned with backend or AI/ML
- Build meaningful open-source/personal projects
